# Milestone 1 README

## How to Run and Test

1. Open up our [RBlockly](https://shmurthy08.github.io/RBlockly/src/design-blocks/index.html) github page.
2. **Drag** the blocks you want to use from the `left` side of the workspace (gray) to the empty white space in the `middle`.
3. Edit variable <u>names</u> and <u>values</u> as needed.
4. Press the `Generate R` button to generate corresponding R code which will appear on the right-hand side of the screen.
5. Click the `Download` button to download the code to a .R file, which can be run in the **R IDE**.

## Features in Progress

1. Blocks connected sequentially, execute sequentially.
2. Blocks added as input to other blocks work for R code generation.

## Callouts

1. The milestone folder contains a copy of all the files.
2. Some of the blocks don't create a new line when added, but that will be fixed by the next milestone.
