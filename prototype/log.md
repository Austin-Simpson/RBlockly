# Milestone 1 Contribution Log

## Dylan Inafuku:
Developed main interface, being the only group member that has prior experience in R from previous courses. Created the custom blocks that implement variable assignment, list creation, as well as common aggregation functions for lists of numbers. Also implemented generate code and download functionality.

#### Relevant repo files:
- [customs_blocks.js](https://github.com/shmurthy08/RBlockly/blob/main/src/design-blocks/customs_blocks.js)
- [index.html](https://github.com/shmurthy08/RBlockly/blob/main/src/design-blocks/index.html)
- [style.css](https://github.com/shmurthy08/RBlockly/blob/main/src/design-blocks/style.css)

## Shree Murthy:
Created and wrote the main README file, design and design2 md files, created github pages deployment and monitored it to make sure it doesn't break. Also provided inputs as to how we can compile/run R files (more specifically mentioned how Python and JavaScript could be looked into). Separated css style into a separate file to have clear distinction.

#### Relevant repo files:
- [Main README.md](https://github.com/shmurthy08/RBlockly/blob/main/README.md)
- [design.md](https://github.com/shmurthy08/RBlockly/blob/main/design.md)
- [design2.md](https://github.com/shmurthy08/RBlockly/blob/main/design2.md)

## Josh Edmondson:

Collaborated closely with Shree on the README, Design, and Design2 markdown files, offering guidance on what aspects to consider and what content to include. Aided Shree in this process, by referring to the Blockly Documentation, ensuring accurate and comprehensive information. Conducted thorough quality assurance testing on the GitHub Pages, identifying opportunities for future enhancements. Suggested the implementation of conditionals, which could further improve the functionality of the platform.

## Rahul Sura:

Tried finding online CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) to be able to run R code. Eventually decided that making a local implementation would be the best option. However, decided to still not have to use an external IDE. Hence, created a file I/O process to compile R files without having user run it manually, and display it in the html file output window. This would all be done using Javascript and interacting with the user's terminal, provided that they have a version of R installed (See image below). Also added a repository link on github page to go back to source repo. Added gitignore.
