To understand how the code generated by Blockly will be executed, let's take a look at some Blockly code blocks and provide pseudo-code representations of their execution. We'll use the previously mentioned Blockly blocks related to creating variables, lists of numbers, and conducting simple statistical functions.

## Blockly Code 1: Creating a Variable

Blockly Code:
```plaintext
Create Variable
Name: my_variable
Value: 42
```

Pseudo-Code Execution:
```python
# Execute the Blockly code
my_variable = 42

# Output
# The variable my_variable is created with the value 42
```

## Blockly Code 2: Creating a List of Numbers

Blockly Code:
```plaintext
Create List
my_list: 10, 20, 30, 40
```

Pseudo-Code Execution:
```python
# Execute the Blockly code
my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40]

# Output
# The variable my_list is created as a list with the provided numbers: [10, 20, 30, 40]
```

## Blockly Code 3: Calculating the Mean

Blockly Code:
```plaintext
Calculate Mean
List: my_list
```

Pseudo-Code Execution:
```python
# Execute the Blockly code
mean_value = mean(my_list) # R has a mean function built-in that can be leveraged

# Output
# The mean of the list my_list is calculated and stored in mean_value
```

## Blockly Code 4: Calculating the Median

Blockly Code:
```plaintext
Calculate Median
List: my_list
```

Pseudo-Code Execution:
```python
# Execute the Blockly code
median = median(my_list) # R has a median function built-in that can be leveraged

# Output
# The median of the list my_list is calculated and stored in median_value
```

## Blockly Code 5: Calculating the Mode

Blockly Code:
```plaintext
Calculate Mode
List: my_list
```

Pseudo-Code Execution:
```python
# Execute the Blockly code
mode = as.numeric(names(sort(table(my_list), decreasing = TRUE)[1]))

# Output
# The mode of the list my_list is calculated and stored in mode_value
```

## Blockly Code 6: Calculating the Range

Blockly Code:
```plaintext
Calculate Range
List: my_list
```

Pseudo-Code Execution:
```python
# Execute the Blockly code
range_value = range(my_list) # R has a range function built-in that can be leveraged

# Output
# The range of the list my_list is calculated and stored in range_value
```

These pseudo-code representations illustrate how each Blockly code block is executed to perform the specified task. The Blockly code is translated into Python-like pseudo-code, and the results are stored in variables as described in the Blockly blocks. The actual execution would involve implementing these operations in the target programming language, in this case, R.


## Recursive Cases for RBlockly:

As of right now, the blocks we have implemented don't allow us to invoke any recursive cases (ex: factorial, fibonacci, etc.). After implementing the functionality fo the above 6 blocks, we can work on adding blocks for conditionals, functions, and etc to allow for recursive cases. Within our current, approved, scope we are going to create the blocks that were mentioned above.

## Data Maintained by RBlockly:

RBlockly won't hold any sensitve data since this is a statistical program that will be used for educational purposes. The only data that will be stored is the data that the user inputs into the provided blocks. Even if it is used professionals they wouldn't use proprietry information for something that is meant to visualize how R works. 


## External Software:

For this project there are no external softwares that are used to test and showcase the project.
